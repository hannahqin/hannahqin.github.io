                <p>This assignment was inspired by the recent design trend of layering botanical illustrations and typography to create a sense of depth in the composition. We were instructed to selected a plant and use the symbolic meaning of the plant as its layered text. A good composition combined quality isolation, effective use of balance and movement, and readable typography.</p>
