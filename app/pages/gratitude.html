                <p>
                    This poster was designed as a part of the Graphic Design (SI 320) course at the University of Michigan. The assignment
                    assignment was to create a poster that combined a botanical illustration with the symbolic meaning of the plant â€“ combining
                    quality isolation, effective use of balance and movement, and readable typography.
