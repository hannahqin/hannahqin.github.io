                <p>
                    This poster was designed as a part of the Graphic Design (SI 320) course at the University of Michigan. We were 
                    presented with the challenge of designing a themed English Alphabet Poster using consistent visuals, colors, and 
                    typography. Each grid element had to be composed of a capital letter, a label, and an image, and only one 
                    typeface could be used for the design.
