                <h6>THE PROJECT</h6>
                <p>Statslete was a Senior Capstone project developed by Tom Sandell, Gautam Visveswaran, and me during our last semester of undergrad. Over the course of a semester in our capstone course (EECS 441: App Development for Entrepreneurs), we were challenged with conceiving, designing, developing, and marketing an application from start to finish.</p>
